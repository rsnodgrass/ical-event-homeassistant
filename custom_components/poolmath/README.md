Creates sensors for pools being managed with Trouble Free Pools's [Pool Math](https://www.troublefreepool.com/blog/poolmath/) apps including [Pool Math iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pool-math-by-troublefreepool/id1228819359) and [Pool Math Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.troublefreepool.poolmath&hl=en_US). 

From the [Trouble Free Pool](https://troublefreepool.com/) website:

* Pool Math makes swimming pool care, maintenance and management easy by tracking chlorine, pH, alkalinity and other  levels to help calculate how much salt, bleach and other chemicals to add.
* Pool Math performs all the calculations you need to keep your chlorine, pH, calcium, alkalinity, and stabilizer levels balanced.
* Trouble Free Pool is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit who displays NO advertising on our site nor is our advice compromised by financial incentives.

#### Supported Pool Math Data

* pH
* Free Chlorine (FC)
* Total Alkalinity (TA)
* Calcium Hardness (CH)
* Cyanuric Acid (CYA)
* Salt
* Borates

Note: this **requires a PoolMath Premium subscription** for cloud access to your pools data.

### Configuration

Under Settings of the Pool Math iOS or Android application, find the Sharing section.  Turn this on, which allows anyone with access to the unique URL to be able to view data about your pool. Your pool's URL will be displayed, use that in the YAML configuration for the poolmath sensor.

```yaml
sensor:
  - type: poolmath
    url: https://troublefreepool.com/mypool/6WPG8yL
```
